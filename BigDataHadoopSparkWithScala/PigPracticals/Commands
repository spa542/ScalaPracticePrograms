For Airport details

1. iata
2. airport
3. city
4. state
5. country
6. lat
7. long





1. Point to directory where code is present
	[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ cd pig180512/ThirdPgm
	[cloudera@quickstart ThirdPgm]$

2. Start PIG
	[cloudera@quickstart ThirdPgm]$ pig -x local
	grunt> 

3. Start executing below commands 
################# To find top 3 destinations ##############################################################
A. Load the data
	grunt> raw_data = LOAD '2008_flightdataMini.csv' USING PigStorage(',');
													aCCESS THE FIELDS: $0, $1, $2, $3

B. Group data by destination
	grunt> flight_details = FOREACH raw_data GENERATE (INT)$0 AS year, (INT)$9 AS flight_num, (CHARARRAY)$16 AS orig,(CHARARRAY) $17 AS dest;
	grunt> flight_validdest = FILTER flight_details BY dest IS NOT NULL;
	grunt> grp_dest = GROUP flight_validdest BY dest;

C. Find the count and fetch top 3 destinations
	grunt> dest_count = FOREACH grp_dest GENERATE group, COUNT(flight_validdest.dest) as cnt;
	grunt> dest_count_ordr = ORDER dest_count BY cnt DESC;
	grunt> dest_top_three = LIMIT dest_count_ordr 3;

D. Load Airport name from different table and join it
	grunt> airport = LOAD 'airports.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (iata, airport, city, state, country, lat,  longi);
	grunt> dest_top_three_airport = JOIN dest_top_three BY $0, airport BY $0;
	grunt > final = FOREACH dest_top_three_airport GENERATE group, airport, cnt; 
 	grunt> dump final;

#################### Get the worst 3 airports with maximum departure delay ###############################
A. Load the data
	grunt> raw_data = load '2008_flightdataMini.csv' USING PigStorage(',');

B. Group data by Origin
	grunt> flight_details = FOREACH raw_data GENERATE (INT)$0 AS year, (INT)$9 AS flight_num, (INT)$15 AS depDelay,(CHARARRAY) $16 AS orig;
	grunt> flight_validorig = FILTER flight_details BY orig IS NOT NULL;
	grunt> grp_orig = GROUP flight_validorig BY orig;

C. Find the avg delay and fetch top 3 airport with max departure delay
	grunt> orig_delay = FOREACH grp_orig GENERATE group, AVG(flight_validorig.depDelay) as avgDelay;
	grunt> orig_delay_ordr = ORDER orig_delay BY avgDelay DESC;
	grunt> orig_delay_top_three = LIMIT orig_delay_ordr 3;

D. Load Airport name from different table and join it
