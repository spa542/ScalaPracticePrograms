1. Go to given directory
[cloudera@quickstart ~]$ cd pig180510
[cloudera@quickstart pig180510]$ cd SecondPgm

2. Start pig locally
[cloudera@quickstart SecondPgm]$ pig -x local

3. Load both files
grunt> file1 = LOAD 'file1' Using PigStorage(',') as (company:chararray, location:chararray, stores:int);
grunt> file2 = LOAD 'file2' Using PigStorage(',') as (company:chararray, location:chararray, stores:int);

4. JOIN
grunt> joined = JOIN file1 BY(company, location), file2 by (company, location);


5. FILTER
grunt> filtered = FILTER file1 BY stores > 24;


6. GROUP
grunt> filtered_grouped = GROUP filtered BY location;


7. COGROUP ( if 2OR MORE fields in BY)
grunt> CGPD = coGROUP file2 BY (company,location), filtered BY (company,location);


8. grunt> out = FOREACH CGPD GENERATE group, COUNT(file2) as count, MAX(filtered.stores) as max;
